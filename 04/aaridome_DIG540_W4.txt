DIG 540 | W4: Data Normalization

FOr my data normalization project I propose an exhibition for audio tracks based on the dominant color of an album cover.
This may not be the most practical way to exhibit audio tracks but I think it would be interesting to see what kind of
visual connections can be made between music and imagery since many people have strong associations with not only the music 
but also the visuals of album covers (color, photography, typography, etc.).

My database diagram is faily simple â€” the only new information is the color field. Each album would be identified with one
dominant color. I am not sure how specific the colors would get at this point. Perhaps the user would be able to select a 
color from blocks of colors or from a gradation. Once the color was selected the user would be shown all of the albums 
that have that color as the dominant color on the album. Upon selecting a particular album the user would be shown typical 
information such as the album name, artist, year, genre, and tracks. The most interesting part of this exhibition would be
seeing what kind of albums would come up based on color. Depending on the depth of the database it could pull albums from 
a wider variety of genres and countries than one would normally expect.

I am not sure images work in a database. How would one access the album images and how would those be analyzed and then 
categorized by color? Would the colors be captured and identified in hex code? Also, what is the finite number of colors 
from which the album covers would be categorized?
